3. **Security**: Review security sections across all documents
4. **Decision**: Approve/reject AgentCore Gateway approach

### Phase 2: Planning (Weeks 1-2)
1. Schedule AWS AgentCore deep-dive with AWS SA
2. Security review of AgentCore (VPC, PrivateLink, IAM)
3. Proof-of-concept: Deploy AgentCore Gateway with 1 tool
4. Cost model validation with Finance

### Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 3-20)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A**: Depends on your role:
- **Executive**: REFINEMENTS-SUMMARY.md
- **Architect**: ARCHITECTURE-REFINED.md
- **Engineer**: ARCHITECTURE-COMPARISON.md then ARCHITECTURE-REFINED.md

### Q: Do I need to read the original execution-agrden.md?
**A**: Only if you want the full research depth on Phase 1-2 components. The refined documents cover Phase 3-4 in detail, but refer to original for Phase 1-2.

### Q: What's the most important change in v2.0?
**A**: AgentCore Gateway for MCP hosting - saves $3.6K/year and eliminates 90% of operational burden vs self-hosting.

### Q: Is AgentCore production-ready?
**A**: Yes, GA October 2025. Early adopters include major bank (Itaú Unibanco), Autodesk, Cisco, Workday.

### Q: Can we still self-host if we want control?
**A**: Yes, but not recommended. AgentCore Gateway provides more control (semantic search, tool governance) with less burden. You can also run hybrid - use AgentCore for most tools, connect to your self-hosted MCP servers if needed.

### Q: What about vendor lock-in?
**A**: Low risk - MCP is open protocol adopted by Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft. Agents remain portable. You can move between MCP implementations.
