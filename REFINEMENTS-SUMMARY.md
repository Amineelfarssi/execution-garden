**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Author:** Architecture Team

## Executive Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the key architectural refinements made after evaluating **llmgateway.io** and **AWS AgentCore** (announced July 2025, GA October 2025).

---

## Major Architectural Changes

### 1. MCP Hosting: AgentCore Gateway (Critical Change) ⭐

**Previous Recommendation**: Self-host MCP servers on ECS Fargate
- Cost: $240/month for ECS tasks + $73/month for supporting services = $313/month
- Complexity: Manual container management, scaling, OAuth implementation
- Timeline: 4 weeks to deploy and test

**New Recommendation**: AWS AgentCore Gateway (Managed Service)
- Cost: $0.005 per 1,000 tool calls = **$5/month for 1M calls** (97% cost reduction)
- Complexity: Zero infrastructure management, built-in OAuth 2.1, automatic scaling
- Timeline: 1 week to configure and test
- Features: Zero-code MCP tool creation from OpenAPI specs, Lambda functions, Smithy models

**Impact**: 
- Eliminates $3,636/year in infrastructure costs
- Reduces operational burden by 90%
- Faster time-to-market (3 weeks saved)
- Better security (managed OAuth, IAM integration)

### 2. Agent Runtime: AgentCore Runtime (New Option)

**Previous Gap**: No recommended solution for agents requiring >15 minute execution time

**New Recommendation**: AWS AgentCore Runtime for long-running agents
- Supports up to 8-hour execution windows
- Complete session isolation in microVMs
- OAuth integration with corporate IdP
- Cost: ~$0.003647/session (120s average) = $109/month for 30K sessions
- 56% cheaper than equivalent EC2/ECS solution
- Seamless integration with AgentCore Gateway tools

**When to use**:
- Agents requiring >15 minutes execution
- Complex multi-agent orchestration
- Long-running reasoning workflows
- Need for persistent session state

**When to use Lambda instead**:
- Simple request-response (<15 minutes)
- Stateless operations
- Cost-sensitive high-volume short bursts

### 3. LLM Gateway: Confirmed LiteLLM over llmgateway.io

**Evaluated**: llmgateway.io (open-source, launched 2024)

**Decision**: **Recommend LiteLLM** (not llmgateway.io)

**Reasons**:
1. **License**: LiteLLM is Apache 2.0 (permissive), llmgateway.io is AGPLv3 (copyleft requiring open-sourcing derivatives)
2. **Maturity**: LiteLLM has 480B+ tokens production track record, llmgateway.io <1 year old
3. **Banking adoption**: LiteLLM proven in regulated industries, llmgateway.io too new
4. **Community**: LiteLLM 12K+ GitHub stars, llmgateway.io 200+ stars
5. **Features**: LiteLLM has enterprise guardrails integrations, llmgateway.io basic

**llmgateway.io strengths**:
- Modern TypeScript architecture
- Good BYOK support
- Clean UI and analytics
- Active development

**llmgateway.io concerns**:
- AGPLv3 copyleft license creates compliance risk for proprietary banking modifications
- Limited production references
- Early-stage maturity (<1 year)
- Basic guardrails (critical for banking)

## Developer Experience Improvements

### MCP Tool Creation

**Previous** (Self-hosted MCP server):
```python
# Write custom MCP server code
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent

server = Server("financial-tools")

@server.tool()
async def calculate_npv(
    cash_flows: list[float],
    discount_rate: float
) -> TextContent:
    # Implement NPV logic
    npv = sum(cf / (1 + discount_rate) ** i 
              for i, cf in enumerate(cash_flows))
    return TextContent(text=f"NPV: ${npv:,.2f}")

# Deploy to ECS, manage scaling, OAuth, etc.
```

**Refined** (AgentCore Gateway):
```bash
# Zero-code tool creation from Lambda
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name calculate-npv \
  --runtime python3.12 \
  --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
  --zip-file fileb://npv-calculator.zip

# Add to AgentCore Gateway
aws bedrock-agentcore create-target \
  --gateway-identifier arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:...:gateway/GATEWAY_ID \
  --target-name "financial-calcs" \
  --target-type "LAMBDA" \
  --lambda-configuration FunctionArn=arn:aws:lambda:...:function:calculate-npv
  
# Done! Tool automatically available via MCP
```

**Result**: 10x faster tool creation, no MCP protocol knowledge required

### Agent Connection

**Previous**: Agent must implement MCP client protocol
**Refined**: Use AgentCore SDK or framework-native MCP support

```python
# Strands Agents with AgentCore
from strands_agents import Agent, AgentCoreClient

agentcore = AgentCoreClient(
    gateway_url="https://bedrock-agentcore.../gateways/GATEWAY_ID/mcp",
    auth_provider="cognito"
)

agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    mcp_client=agentcore.get_mcp_client()  # Automatic tool discovery
)
```

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not use llmgateway.io if it's open-source and similar to LiteLLM?
**A**: AGPLv3 copyleft license requires open-sourcing any modifications - unacceptable for proprietary banking extensions. LiteLLM's Apache 2.0 allows private modifications.

### Q: Is AgentCore Gateway production-ready?
**A**: Yes, GA October 2025 with VPC, PrivateLink, CloudFormation, IAM support. Early adopters include Itaú Unibanco (major bank), Autodesk, Cisco, Workday.

### Q: What if we want to run our own MCP servers?
**A**: AgentCore Gateway can connect to external MCP servers via its target configuration - you can run both managed and self-hosted in hybrid model.

### Q: Can we mix Lambda and AgentCore Runtime?
**A**: Yes, recommended. Use Lambda for short-running stateless agents, AgentCore Runtime for long-running workflows. Right-size for workload.

### Q: What about vendor lock-in with AgentCore?
**A**: MCP is open protocol (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft adopted). Gateway implements standard MCP so agents remain portable. Lock-in risk is low.
