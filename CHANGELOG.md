# Changelog

All notable changes to the Execution Garden Architecture will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Detailed network diagrams with Transit Gateway routing
- Terraform modules for Phase 1 deployment
- Lambda function code examples
- Guardrails configuration templates
- Cost calculator spreadsheet

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Initial comprehensive architecture document
- Three-phase implementation approach (Serverless → Multi-provider → Self-hosted)
- LiteLLM gateway design on ECS Fargate
- Cross-account IAM architecture with External IDs
- Transit Gateway integration patterns
- AWS Bedrock Guardrails configuration (99% accuracy)
- NeMo Guardrails supplementary layer
- OpenTelemetry observability framework
- Langfuse self-hosted deployment pattern
- MCP hosting and agent cataloging architecture
- Banking compliance framework (SR 11-7, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- 16-week implementation roadmap
- 3-year TCO analysis ($2.85M)
- LLM gateway comparison matrix (LiteLLM, Portkey, Kong)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Technical Decisions
- **Serverless-first**: Lambda + API Gateway for Phase 1 (6-8 weeks to production)
- **Containers when justified**: ECS Fargate only for multi-provider orchestration
- **LiteLLM selected**: Over Portkey and Kong for self-hosted gateway
- **Hybrid deployment**: Maintain serverless layer alongside containers
- **AWS Bedrock primary**: External providers (OpenAI, Gemini) secondary

### Architecture Principles
- Memoryless operations account (data sovereignty)
- Business unit data isolation (CloudWatch in source account)
- Centralized audit trails (CloudTrail in Security account)
- Multi-layer guardrails (99%+ combined accuracy)
- Phase-gated deployment (minimize risk)

### Cost Optimization
- Phase 1: $165/month infrastructure + Bedrock consumption
- Phase 2: $1,070/month infrastructure
- Provisioned Throughput reduces Bedrock costs 40-60%
- Graviton2 Lambda saves 20% on compute
- VPC PrivateLink eliminates data transfer costs

### Compliance Features
- PII detection via Amazon Comprehend
- Content filtering via Bedrock Guardrails
- Prompt injection prevention via NeMo Guardrails
- Audit logging with 7-year retention
- Cross-account access controls
- KMS encryption per business unit

## Version History

### Version Numbering Convention

**Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **MAJOR**: Breaking architecture changes, paradigm shifts
- **MINOR**: New phases, significant capability additions, non-breaking changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, clarifications, documentation improvements

### Examples
- `2.0.0` - Migration to different gateway platform (breaking)
- `1.1.0` - Addition of Phase 4 for edge deployment (non-breaking)
- `1.0.1` - Correction to cost calculations (patch)
